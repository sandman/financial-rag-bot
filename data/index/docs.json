[{"doc": "Factsheet_F00000O4Y0_52.pdf", "page": 1, "text": "Fund overview Objective: The Fund aims to provide an investment return with a low level of capital volatility whilst maintaining liquidity. The performance of the Sub-Fund is measured against Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) Rate (the benchmark). Investments: The Sub-Fund will invest in a diversified portfolio of sterling denominated debt and money market instruments including, but not limited to, financial and corporate floating rate notes, asset-backed floating rate notes, certificate of deposits, commercial paper, reverse repo, term deposits and money market funds. The weighted average maturity of the fund\u2019s investments will not exceed 365 days. Strategy: The Sub-Fund is actively managed. The Investment Manager uses credit and interest rate analysis to assemble a highly liquid portfolio of securities while seeking to maximise yields. The investment manager intends where possible, to manage the Fund according to the restrictions imposed by the rating agency in order to maintain an overall credit rating of Aaa by Fitch Investor Services (the rating has been solicited by the Investment Manager). Full details of the Fund\u2019s Objective & Investment Policy are available on our website and prospectus. For further information on Sustainability Risk please refer to the Sustainable Finance Disclosure section. On 14th May 2021 the Fund benchmark was changed from 7-Day LIBID rate (The London Interbank Bid Rate LIBID) to the Sterling Overnight Index Average (SONIA) rate. Historic benchmark performance is shown up to 14th May 2021 for the 7-Day LIBID rate.

Sustainable Finance Disclosure The Sub-Fund seeks to promote environmental and social characteristics. ESG considerations, and an evaluation of Sustainability Risks and good governance principles are integrated when selecting investments. The investments, where it is possible, will be aligned with the environmental/ social characteristics and will be selected based on specific ESG investment criteria outlined within the Prospectus. There may on occasion be investments used for hedging and efficient portfolio management purposes which are not possible to be aligned with the environmental or social characteristics described. The Fund does not have a sustainable investment objective, and the Investment Manager will consider adverse impacts of an investment to the extent they are financially material. For further information please refer to the prospectus and our website. Fund risks Investment Risk & Currency Risk The value of investments and the income from them will change over time. The Fund price may fall as well as rise and as a result you may not get back the original amount you invested. Money Market Securities Risk The Fund invests in money market instruments such as short term bank debt, the market prices/value of which can rise as well as fall on a daily basis. Their values are affected by changes in interest rates, inflation and any decline in creditworthiness of the issuer. This is not a guaranteed investment, an investment in a Money Market Fund is different from an investment in deposits and can fluctuate in price meaning you may not get back the original amount you invested. This investment does not rely on external support for guaranteeing liquidity or stabilising the NAV per unit or share. The risk of loss of the principal is to be borne by the investor. Sustainability Risk The level of sustainability risk may fluctuate depending on which investment opportunities the Investment Manager identifies. This means that the fund is exposed to Sustainability Risk which may impact the value of investments over the long term. Full information on risks applicable to the Fund are in the Prospectus and the Key Investor Information Document (KIID). Glossary 30 Day Yield Average of gross (before expenses) daily dividends over the last thirty days annualised as a percentage of total net assets. Annualised performance An annualised total return is the geometric average amount of money earned by an investment each year over a given time period. Credit Rating Independent ratings agencies assign different ratings to bonds depending on the bond issuers\u2019 financial strength and their outlook as well as their ability to pay interest on time and meet all of their liabilities. We use appropriate industry recognised ratings as detailed in source notes. Daily yield Gross (before expenses) daily dividends annualised as a percentage of total net assets. Entry fee A one-off charge may be taken from your money before it is invested. The charge is usually a percentage of the amount invested and is additional to the price paid for the units/shares. The entry charge is deducted from the investment before units/shares are bought and is also known as the \u201cinitial charge\u201d . Exit charge A one-off charge levied on redemption of units/shares before the proceeds of your investment are paid out. This is also known as a \u201credemption charge\u201d . Management Fee The management fee is fixed rate charge to cover the costs of managing the investments of the fund. It accrues daily based on a percentage of the fund's net asset value and deducted from the fund's assets. NAV Page 2 of 3 | Aviva Investors Sterling Liquidity Plus Fund 4 GBP Acc.

open-ended umbrella investment company in that Shares representing interests in different Sub-Funds may be issued from time to time by the Directors. Shares of more than one class may be issued in relation to a Sub-Fund. All Shares of each class will rank pari passu save as otherwise provided for in the relevant section of Part 1 for the relevant Sub-Fund. On the introduction of any new Sub-Fund (for which the prior approval of the Central Bank is required) or any new class of Shares (which must be issued in accordance with the requirements of the Central Bank), the Fund will prepare and the Directors will issue a supplement setting out the relevant details of each such Sub-Fund or new class of Shares. A separate portfolio of assets will be maintained for each Sub-Fund (and accordingly not for each class of Shares) and will be invested in accordance with the investment objective and policies applicable to such Sub-Fund. Particulars relating to the Sub-Funds of the Fund and the classes of Shares available therein are set out herein in Part 1. Aviva Investors Global Services Limited (the \u2018Investment Manager\u2019) serves as investment manager of the Fund and as a distributor of its Shares. The Fund may decline any application for Shares in whole or in part without assigning any reason therefor. After the initial issue of Shares at the Initial Issue Price, Shares will be issued and redeemed at the Net Asset Value per Share in accordance with the provisions summarised under \u2018Issue and Redemption Prices / Calculation of Net Asset Value / Valuation of Assets\u2019 in Part 2. A currency conversion will take place at the prevailing exchange rates on the issue, redemption and exchange of Shares or on distribution where applicable. Details of Dealing Days in respect of each Sub-Fund appear in Part 1.

The weighted average life of the Sub-Fund\u2019s investments will not exceed 120 days. The Sub-Fund may also hold ancillary liquid assets such as bank deposits. The Sub-Fund is subject to and managed in accordance with the portfolio rules of Article 24 of the Money Market Fund Regulation.

The Fund will, on request, provide supplementary information to Shareholders relating to the risk management methods employed, including the quantitative limits that are applied and any recent developments in the risk and yield characteristics of the main categories of investments in financial derivative instruments. Under the Regulations, the Sub-Fund may utilise financial derivative instruments subject to the following terms and conditions:- 1. The global exposure of the Sub-Fund relating to financial derivative instruments must not exceed its total net asset value; 2.

The Investment Manager integrates qualitative and quantitative data on adverse sustainability impacts into its investment processes. The ESG analysis and considerations described are incorporated into the investment process but may not always have a material impact on investments in the Sub-Fund.

Rating Award The Fund has obtained an \u201cAaa-mf\u201d money market rating from Moody\u2019s Investors Service (\u201cMoody\u2019s\u201d) and an AAAm rating from Standard & Poor\u2019s (\u201cS&P\u201d) for the Sub-Fund. When awarding this rating Moody\u2019s and S&P take into account, inter alia, the Sub-Fund's portfolio quality, its counterparties and management, operating procedures and controls, regulatory compliance and market price risk relative to the Sub- Fund's published objectives. The Directors intend to operate the Sub-Fund in accordance with Moody's and S&P\u2019s requirements to maintain the rating awards. The rating was solicited or financed by the Sub-Fund or its Investment Manager. Liquidity Management Procedures The Sub-Fund will be managed in accordance with the Liquidity Management Procedures for LVNAV Short Term Money Market Funds as described in Part 2 of the Prospectus. Profile of Typical Investor A typical investor is an institutional investor looking for a low risk return based upon UK money market instruments. The Sub-Fund is suited to short-term cash investors who are looking for a highly liquid fund. Through its daily liquidity facility, the Sub-Fund is structured to give investors easy access to their cash whenever required. The level of an investment will determine the class of Shares an investor may subscribe for. Classes 4 and 9 are only available to Shareholders that have a separate mandate with the Investment Manager or its affiliates. Risk Factors The general risk factors as set out in Part 2 of the Prospectus shall apply. In addition to the general risk factors outlined in Part 2 of the Prospectus, investors should also note that the Sub- Fund is not a guaranteed investment. A subscription for Shares of the Sub Fund is not the same as placing funds on deposit with a bank or other deposit-taking body and the principal invested in the Sub-Fund is capable of fluctuation. The Sub-Fund does not rely on external support for guaranteeing the liquidity of the Sub-Fund or stabilising the NAV per share. The risk of loss of the principal shall be borne by the Shareholder. The value of the Sub Fund may be affected by the creditworthiness of issuers of the Sub Fund's investments and, notwithstanding the policy of the Sub Fund of investing in short term instruments, may also be affected by substantial adverse movements in interest rates.

Dividends of the Sub-Fund\u2019s net income attributable to those Shares will be declared daily and payable monthly on or about the first Business Day of each following month. For this purpose, net income (from the time immediately preceding determination thereof) shall consist of interest and dividends earned by the Sub-Fund. The Directors may at their discretion adjust dividends to take account of realised and unrealised profits on the disposal / valuation of investments as may be lawfully distributed less realised/ unrealised losses (including fees and expenses) of the Sub-Fund. No dividends shall be paid out of the capital of the Sub-Fund. Notwithstanding the above, the Directors may, at their discretion and if they consider it to be in the best interests of Shareholders of the Sub-Fund or relevant class of Shares, determine not to declare all or substantially all of the net income of the Sub Fund attributable to the Shares on a Dealing Day as a dividend to Shareholders of the Shares. In the event that the Directors determine not to declare all or substantially all of the net income of the Sub Fund attributable to the Shares on a Dealing Day as a dividend to Shareholders of the Shares, any distributable net income not declared will remain in the Sub-Fund\u2019s assets and will be reflected in the Net Asset Value of the Shares. Dividends payable to Shareholders of distributing Shares will be re-invested each month by subscription for additional Shares in the Sub-Fund unless Shareholders specifically request that dividends be paid by telegraphic transfer. Additional Shares will be issued to Shareholders at a price calculated in the same way as for other issues of the Shares on the same date. There is no minimum of such further Shares which may be so subscribed. In the case of Shareholders who request the redemption of part of their Shares, the payment to them of accrued dividends on those Shares will, if the date of redemption is other than the first Business Day of any month, be made (together with the dividend entitlement on the balance of the Shareholder's holding of Shares) on the second Business Day of the next month following the redemption. In the case of Shareholders who request the redemption of all of their Shares and the payment to them of accrued dividends, such dividends will be paid at the time of such redemption. Dividend Policy for Class 10-14 and Class W (Accumulating) Shares Dividends will not be paid on Classes 10 \u2013 14 or Class W (Accumulating) as such classes are accumulating share classes. The net income (if any) attributable to the Class 10 \u2013 14 and Class W (Accumulating) Shares shall be retained within the Sub-Fund and the value of the Shares will vary accordingly.

The Sub-Fund is an Ultra Short Duration bond fund which aims to offer medium term cash investors (typically at least three to six months) higher returns than those available from a traditional money market fund for only a moderate increase in credit and liquidity risk.

Risk Factors The general risk factors as set out in Part 2 of the Prospectus shall apply. In addition to the general risk factors outlined in Part 2 of the Prospectus, investors should also note that the Sub-Fund is not a guaranteed investment.

Investment Objective and Policies"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 77, "text": "77 The Articles provide that the investment objective and policies for each Sub-Fund will be formulated by the Directors at the time of the creation of that Sub-Fund. Details of the investment objective and policies for each Sub-Fund of the Fund appear in the relevant section of Part 1 for the relevant Sub-Fund. Any change in the investment objective or material change to the investment policies of a Sub- Fund may only be made with the approval of an ordinary resolution of the Shareholders of the Sub-Fund. In the event of a change of investment objective and/or policies of a Sub-Fund, the Manager will ensure that a reasonable notification period must be given to each Shareholder of the Sub-Fund to enable a Shareholder to have its Shares redeemed prior to the implementation of such change. In the event that the Fund utilises financial derivative instruments for a sub-fund, the Fund will upon request provide information to Shareholders on the risk management methods employed in respect of the relevant Sub-Fund including the quantitative limits that are applied and any recent developments in the risk and yield characteristics of the main categories of investments. Efficient Portfolio Management Subject to the Regulations and to the conditions within the limits laid down by the Central Bank from time to time, the Fund, on behalf of a Sub-Fund may employ techniques and instruments including financial derivative instruments solely for the purposes of (i) the reduction of risk, (ii) the reduction of costs, and/ or (iii) the generation of additional capital or income for the Fund with no, or with an acceptably low level of, risk subject to the provisions set out in the relevant section of Part 1 for the relevant Sub-Fund. Where the Sub-Fund utilises financial derivatives instruments, such instruments will be dealt in on a regulated market specified in the Articles and/or over the counter derivatives \u201cOTCs\u201d. The following is a description of the types of financial derivative instruments which may be used by a Sub-Fund where provided for in relevant section of Part 1 relating to such Sub-Fund: \uf0b7 Currency Swaps In a standard swap transaction, two parties agree to exchange returns (or differentials in rates of return) calculated with respect to a notional amount, e.g. the return on or increase in value of a particular dollar amount invested at a particular interest rate, in a particular foreign currency. Swaps in which a Sub-Fund may invest include currency swaps. A currency swap is an agreement negotiated between two parties to exchange the return on cash for the return on varying currencies. \uf0b7 Currency Forwards A forward contract locks in the price at which an asset may be purchased or sold on a future date. A Sub-Fund may buy and sell currencies on a spot and forward basis, subject to the limits and restrictions adopted by the Central Bank from time to time to reduce the risks of adverse changes in exchange rates. A forward currency exchange contract, which involves an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date at a price set at the time of the contract, reduces a Sub-Fund's exposure to changes in the value of the currency it will deliver and increases its exposure to changes in the value of the currency it will receive for the duration of the contract. A contract to sell currency would limit any potential gain, which might be realised"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 78, "text": "78 if the value of the hedged currency increases. \uf0b7 Futures Futures are contracts to buy or sell a standard quantity of a specific asset (or, in some cases, receive or pay cash based on the performance of an underlying asset, instrument or index) at a pre-determined future date and at a price agreed through a transaction undertaken on an exchange. Futures contracts allow investors to hedge against market risk or gain exposure to the underlying market (where permitted by the investment policies and restrictions for a Sub- Fund). Since these contracts are marked-to-market daily, investors can, by closing out their position, exit from their obligation to buy or sell the underlying assets prior to the contract's delivery date. \uf0b7 Options The seller (writer) of a call option which is covered (i.e. the writer holds the underlying security) assumes the risk of a decline in the market price of the underlying security below the purchase price of the underlying security less the premium received, and gives up the opportunity for gain on the underlying security above the exercise price of the option. The seller of an uncovered call option assumes the risk of a theoretically-unlimited increase in the market price of the underlying security above the exercise price of the option. The securities necessary to satisfy the exercise of the call option may be unavailable for purchase except at much higher prices. Purchasing securities to satisfy the exercise of the call option can itself cause the price of the securities to rise further, sometimes by a significant amount, thereby exacerbating the loss. The buyer of a call option assumes the risk of losing its entire investment in the call option. The seller (writer) of a put option which is covered (i.e. the writer has a short position in the underlying security) assumes the risk of an increase in the market price of the underlying security above the sales price (in establishing the short position) of the underlying security plus the premium received, and gives up the opportunity for gain on the underlying security below the exercise price of the option. The seller of an uncovered put option assumes the risk of a decline in the market price of the underlying security below the exercise price of the option. The buyer of a put option assumes the risk of losing its entire investment in the put option. A Sub-Fund may enter into these contracts to hedge against exchange risk. Suitable hedging transactions may not be available in all circumstances and there can be no assurance that the Sub-Fund will engage in such transactions at any given time or from time to time. Operational Costs/Fees Direct and indirect operational costs and/or fees arising from the use of techniques and instruments for Efficient Portfolio Management purposes on behalf of a Sub-Fund may be deducted and the Manager will ensure that the balance of such revenue is delivered to the relevant Sub-Fund. These costs and/or fees will be charged at normal commercial rates and will not include hidden revenue.

Internal Credit Quality Assessment Procedures \u2013 Money Market Funds"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 86, "text": "86 Internal Credit Quality Assessment Procedures The Investment Manager's analysts monitor holdings by reading regulatory filings, financial report and accounts, monitoring relevant security and industry news and events (through, for example, Bloomberg (or equivalent) and street (market) research), maintaining robust financial models, and keeping dialogue with management teams (earnings conference calls, phone calls, on-site visits, etc.) to continuously monitor portfolio holdings. This helps the Investment Manager stay dynamic with its investment recommendations and helps ensure the relevant Sub- Funds' portfolios incorporate the securities with the optimal risk/return profile. Internal rating The internal rating conveys probability of default and loss given default over a two year horizon. To establish this rating, analysts conduct a detailed review of the company, including understanding key risks in the company\u2019s business model, financials and financial policies, and ESG factors (as described below). The credit fundamental review process can be broadly separated into assessing the business risks inherent in the company\u2019s operating model and the resultant financial risks. The Investment Manager does not rely on external credit ratings, and therefore undertakes internal rating assignments to act as an independent assessment of an issuer\u2019s credit quality. The review of financials is driven by detailed analysis of published statements and discussions with management with respect to financial policies, recent performance indicators and future performance outlook. Specific factors will vary across industries but will likely involve a mix of solvency/leverage measures, size and profitability measures, among other factors. Both cash flow and balance sheet risks are evaluated and important. It is important to note that while the internal rating captures an assessment of borrower worthiness at a point in time there is a forward looking aspect to the rating, as the analyst will include their best estimate of where the fundamentals are heading over the time horizon, given all available information. The internal rating captures where the analyst sees the issuer heading in the long-term. The internal rating is expressed on a scale comparable to those used in the rating agencies, with iAAA being the highest, and iC- the lowest. Fundamental (\u201cF\u201d score) The factors driving the F score are similar to those considered by the internal rating, though the F score conveys the marginal change in fundamentals, therefore reflecting a six month time horizon. There may be periods where these two measures are at odds, as an analyst may see long-term improvements in an issuer who is subject to shorter-term cyclical deterioration. F scores provide the analyst's view of the direction and magnitude of change in underlying fundamentals at the issuer level over a six to twelve month time horizon. It is scored on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being an expected sharp deterioration and 5 being an expected sharp improvement. Subscriptions and Redemptions Account"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 87, "text": "87 The Fund has established an Umbrella Cash Account through which all subscription, redemptions, dividends or cash distributions payable to or from a Sub-Fund are channelled and managed.

These obligations include the requirement for the Depositary to have clear oversight and monitor the Fund's cash flows as well as be informed about all payments made by or on behalf of investors upon the subscription of Shares in a Sub Fund. In addition, the Fund, the Administrator and the Depositary have a policy in place in respect of the maintenance and monitoring of the Umbrella Cash Account which is reviewed at least annually and provides for daily reconciliation of the Umbrella Cash Account against the Fund's records. As the Umbrella Cash Account is maintained at the level of the Fund rather than each Sub- Fund, investors should be aware of the following risk which reflect the fact that the Fund is an umbrella fund with a number of Sub-Funds: -subscription monies received in respect of a Sub-Fund in advance of the issue of Shares will be held in the Umbrella Cash Account in the name of the Depositary on behalf of the Fund and will be treated as an asset of the relevant Sub-Fund.

The value of investments and the income from them, and therefore the value of and income from Shares relating to each Sub-Fund can go down as well as up and an investor may not get back the amount he invests. Changes in exchange rates between currencies or the conversion from one currency to another may also cause the value of the investments to diminish or increase. The value of Shares expressed in a currency other than the Base Currency will be subject to exchange rate risk in relation to the Base Currency. Segregated Liability between the Funds Each Sub-Fund is a segregated portfolio of assets and will accordingly bear its own liabilities and will be solely liable to third parties for all of the liabilities of the relevant Sub-Fund. While the provisions of the Companies Act 2014 provide for segregated liability between Sub-Funds, these provisions have yet to be tested in foreign courts, in particular, in satisfying local creditor claims. At the date of this Prospectus, the Directors are not aware of any such existing or contingent liability. Control of Investments The Fund and the Investment Manager will not have control over the activities of any company or collective investment scheme invested in by a Sub-Fund. Managers of collective investment schemes and companies in which a Sub-Fund may invest may manage the collective investment schemes or be managed in a manner not anticipated by the Fund or the Investment Manager. Conflict of Interest Risk Subject to the Regulations, and, in the case of Money Market funds, the MMFR, a Sub-Fund may invest a portion of its assets in unquoted investments. The Fund may consult the Manager and/or the Investment Manager with respect to the valuation of unquoted investments. There is an inherent conflict of interest between the involvement of the Manager and the Investment Manager in determining the valuation price of a Sub-Fund\u2019s unquoted investments and the Manager's and the Investment Manager\u2019s other responsibilities. Furthermore, as the fees of the Manager and the Investment Manager are based on the Net Asset Value, if the Net Asset Value increases so too does the fees payable to such parties and accordingly there is a conflict of interest for the Manager and the Investment Manager in determining the valuation price of a Sub-Fund\u2019s investments."}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 90, "text": "90 Witholding Tax The income and gains of a Sub-Fund from its assets may suffer withholding tax which may not be reclaimable in the countries where such income and gains arise. If this position changes in the future and the application of a lower rate results in a repayment to the relevant Sub-Fund, the Net Asset Value will not be re-stated and the benefit will be allocated to the existing Shareholders rateably at the time of repayment. Stocklending Risk Subject to the Regulations, a Sub-Fund (that is not a Money Market Fund), where specified in the relevant section of Part 1, may enter into stocklending arrangements for Efficient Portfolio Management purposes and there are risks in the exposure to market movements if recourse has to be had to collateral, or if there is fraud or negligence on the part of the Depositary, Investment Manager or lending agent. In addition there is an operational risk associated with marking to market daily valuations and there are the potential stability risks of providers of collateral. The principal risk in such stocklending arrangements is the insolvency or default of the borrower. In this event the Sub-Fund could experience delays in recovering its securities and such event could possibly result in capital losses. As with any extensions of credit, there are risks of delay and recovery. For securities lending made with connected persons of the Depositary, it must be made on arm\u2019s length commercial terms and the Depositary\u2019s written consent is required. Investors should refer to the section entitled \u201cPortfolio Transactions and Conflicts of Interest\u201d below for further details. Collateral Risk Cash received as collateral may be invested in other eligible securities, including shares of a short term money market fund in accordance with the requirements of the Central Bank, and, in the case of a Money Market Fund, the requirements set out in the Money Market Fund Regulation. Investing this cash subjects that investment, as well as any securities loaned, to market appreciation or depreciation and the risks associated with such investments, such as failure or default of the issuer of the relevant security. Repurchase Agreements Subject to the conditions and limits set out in the Central Bank UCITS Regulations, and, in the case of a Money Market Fund, the requirements set out in the Money Market Fund Regulation, a Sub-Fund may enter into repurchase agreements, where specified in the relevant section of Part 1 for each Sub-Fund. The value of the security purchased may be more or less than the price at which the counterparty has agreed to purchase the security. If the other party to a repurchase agreement should default, the Sub-Fund might suffer a loss to the extent that the proceeds from the sale of the underlying securities and other collateral held by the Fund in connection with the refuted repurchase agreement are less than the repurchase price. In addition, in the event of bankruptcy or similar proceedings of the other party to the repurchase agreement or its failure to repurchase the securities as agreed, the Sub-Fund could suffer losses, including loss of interest on or principal of the security and costs associated with delay and enforcement of the repurchase agreement."}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 91, "text": "91 Reverse Repurchase Agreements Reverse repurchase transactions involve risks in that (a) in the event of the failure of the counterparty with which cash of a Sub-Fund has been placed there is the risk that collateral received may realise less than the cash placed out, whether because of inaccurate pricing of the collateral, adverse market movements, a deterioration in the credit rating of issuers of the collateral, or the illiquidity of the market in which the collateral is traded; and that (b) (i) locking cash in transactions of excessive size or duration, (ii) delays in recovering cash placed out, or (iii) difficulty in realising collateral may restrict the ability of the Sub-Fund to meet redemption requests, security purchases or, more generally, reinvestment. Derivatives Risk While the prudent use of financial derivative instruments can be beneficial, it can also involve risks different from, and in certain cases greater than, the risks presented by more traditional investments. The use of techniques and instruments also involves certain special risks, including (1) dependence on the ability to predict movements in the prices of securities being hedged and movements in interest rates, (2) imperfect correlation between the hedging instruments and the securities or market sectors being hedged, (3) the fact that skills needed to use these instruments are different from those needed to select the Sub-Fund\u2019s securities and (4) the possible absence of a liquid market for any particular instrument at any particular time, and (5) possible impediments to Effective Portfolio Management. Futures Transactions in futures involve the obligation to make, or to take, delivery of the underlying asset of the contract at a future date, or in some cases to settle the Fund\u2019s position with cash. They may carry a higher degree of risk. The gearing or leverage often obtainable in futures (where applicable) trading means that a small deposit or down payment can lead to large losses as well as gains. It also means that a relatively small market movement can lead to a proportionately much larger movement in the value of the Fund\u2019s investment, and this can work against the Fund as well as for the Fund. Futures transactions have a contingent liability, and investors should be aware of the implications of this, in particular the margining requirements. Options The seller (writer) of a call option which is covered (i.e. the writer holds the underlying security) assumes the risk of a decline in the market price of the underlying security below the purchase price of the underlying security less the premium received, and gives up the opportunity for gain on the underlying security above the exercise price of the option. The seller of an uncovered call option assumes the risk of a theoretically-unlimited increase in the market price of the underlying security above the exercise price of the option. The securities necessary to satisfy the exercise of the call option may be unavailable for purchase except at much higher prices. Purchasing securities to satisfy the exercise of the call option can itself cause the price of the securities to rise further, sometimes by a significant amount, thereby exacerbating the loss. The buyer of a call option assumes the risk of losing its entire investment in the call option. The seller (writer) of a put option which is covered (i.e. the writer has a short position in the underlying security) assumes the risk of an increase in the market price of the underlying security above the sales price (in establishing the short position) of the underlying security plus the premium received, and gives up the opportunity for gain on the underlying"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 92, "text": "92 security below the exercise price of the option. The seller of an uncovered put option assumes the risk of a decline in the market price of the underlying security below the exercise price of the option. The buyer of a put option assumes the risk of losing its entire investment in the put option. Sustainability Risk When considering Sustainability Risks, the Investment Manager primarily relies on its in-house Environmental, Social & Governance (ESG) analysis and climate risk indicators to categorise the potential level of Sustainability Risks in a Sub-Fund. Sustainability Risks may arise in respect of an issuer itself, its affiliates or in its supply chain and/or apply to a particular economic sector, geographic area or political region. Environmental risks, including risks arising from climate change, may be associated with events or conditions affecting the natural environment. Social risks may be internal or external to an issuer and may be associated with employees, local communities or customers of companies or populations of countries and/or regions. Governance risks may be associated with the quality, effectiveness and process for the oversight of day to day management of companies, or the governance structures of countries or regions.The level of Sustainability Risk may fluctuate depending on which counterparties and issuers the Investment Manager identifies. A Sub-Fund may be exposed to Sustainability Risks which may impact the value of its investments and may negatively impact upon the Net Asset Value and returns of the Sub-Fund. Currency Risk The Fund may from time to time utilise techniques and instruments to seek to protect (hedge) against currency fluctuations either on a spot basis or by buying currency exchange forward or swap contracts. Currency spot, forward or swap contracts do not eliminate fluctuations in the prices of a Sub-Fund's securities or in foreign exchange rates, or prevent loss if the prices of a Sub-Fund's securities should decline. Although these transactions are intended to minimise the risk of loss due to a decline in the value of hedged currency, they also limit any potential gain that might be realised should the value of the hedged currency increase. The precise matching of the relevant contract amounts and the value of the securities involved will not generally be possible because the future value of such securities will change as a consequence of market movements in the value of such securities between the date when the relevant contract is entered into and the date when it matures. The successful execution of a hedging strategy which matches exactly the profile of the investments of any Sub-Fund cannot be assured. It may not be possible to hedge against generally anticipated exchange rate fluctuations at a price sufficient to protect the assets from the anticipated decline in value of the portfolio positions as a result of such fluctuations. In addition, a Sub-Fund may be exposed to credit risks with regard to counterparties with whom the Fund trades as well as risks relating to settlement default. Such risks could result in substantial losses to a Sub-Fund. Cyber Security Risk The Fund and its service providers' use of internet, technology and information systems may expose the Fund and the Sub-Funds to potential risks linked to cyber security breaches of those technological or information systems. Cyber security breaches, amongst other things, could allow an unauthorized party to gain access to proprietary information, customer data, or fund assets, or cause a Sub-Fund and/or its service providers to suffer data corruption or lose operational functionality."}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 93, "text": "93 Suspension of Redemptions A LVNAV Money Market Fund or a Public Debt CNAV Money Market Fund will cease to be treated as such a Money Market Fund, in accordance with the Money Market Fund Regulations, when the period of suspension of redemptions exceeds 15 days in a 90 day period. Pandemic Risk An outbreak of an infectious disease, pandemic or any other serious public health concern could occur in any one or more jurisdictions in which a Sub-Fund may invest, leading to changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles which may have a negative impact on the Fund\u2019s investments and consequently its Net Asset Value. Any such outbreak may also have an adverse effect on the wider global economy and/or markets, such as the ability of exchanges to trade securities and clear and settle transactions, which may negatively impact a Sub- Fund\u2019s investments more generally. In addition a serious outbreak of infectious disease may also be a force majeure event under contracts that the Fund or a Sub-Fund has entered into thereby relieving a counterparty of the timely performance of the services such counterparties have contracted to provide to a Fund or a Sub-Fund (the nature of the services will vary depending on the agreement in question).

Applications for the issue of Shares may be submitted in writing, by facsimile, by telephone to the Fund care of the Administrator, or in certain circumstances by other electronic methods where specifically agreed to in advance by the Fund, provided in each case that an Application Form and any supporting documentation required with regard to anti-money laundering matters/ financial crime or otherwise, shall be submitted in the case of an initial application for Shares (with the original documentation, where required, to follow by post). In the case of retail investors, subscription requests must be sent through an independent financial adviser or other intermediary. However, this should not result in such investors paying more fees than otherwise would have been paid for a direct investment. Applications received after the Dealing Deadline for the relevant Dealing Day shall, unless the Directors shall otherwise agree and provided they are received before the Valuation Point for the relevant Dealing Day, be deemed to have been received by the next Dealing Deadline.

Payment for Shares Payment in respect of the issue of Shares must be made by the relevant Settlement Date by telegraphic transfer in cleared funds in the Base Currency of the relevant Sub-Fund. The Directors or their delegates may, at their discretion, accept payment in other currencies, but such payments will be converted into the relevant Base Currency at the then prevailing exchange rate available to the Administrator and only the net proceeds (after deducting the conversion expenses) will be applied towards payment of the subscription monies. This may result in a delay in processing the application.

Any redemption request having such an effect may be treated by the Fund as a request to redeem the Shareholder\u2019s entire holding of that class of Shares. The Administrator will not accept redemption requests, which are incomplete, until all the necessary information is obtained. Redemption Price The price at which Shares will be redeemed on a Dealing Day is also calculated by ascertaining the Net Asset Value per Share of the relevant class on the relevant Dealing Day. The method of establishing the Net Asset Value of any Sub-Fund and the Net Asset Value per Share of any class of Shares in a Sub-Fund is set out in the Articles as described herein under the heading \u201cCalculation of Net Asset Value/Valuation of Assets\u201d below. No Redemption Charge will be payable on the redemption of Shares in the Fund. When a redemption request has been submitted by an investor who is or is deemed to be a Taxable Irish Person or is acting on behalf of a Taxable Irish Person, the Fund shall deduct from the redemption proceeds an amount which is equal to the tax payable by the Fund to the Irish Revenue Commissioners in respect of the relevant transaction. If redemption requests in respect of any Shares are received by the Fund the implementation on any Dealing Day of which will, in the opinion of the Directors, necessitate the breaking of deposits at a penalty, the redemption price attributable to such Shares will be reduced by a proportionate part of such reduction in value or penalty, which, will be suffered by the relevant Sub-Fund in such manner, as the Directors may consider fair and equitable and is approved by the Depositary. Alternatively, the Directors may arrange for the Fund to borrow monies in accordance with the \u201cBorrowing and Lending Powers\u201d section set out above and the costs of such borrowing will be apportioned as aforesaid to such extent as the Directors may consider fair and equitable. The Directors consider that the provisions of this paragraph shall only be utilised in exceptional circumstances. Payment of Redemption Proceeds The amount due on redemption of Shares will be paid by telegraphic transfer to an account nominated by the Shareholder in the Base Currency of the relevant Sub-Fund (or in such other currency as the Directors shall determine) by the Settlement Date. Payment of redemption proceeds will be made to the registered Shareholder or in favour of the joint registered Shareholders as appropriate. Third party payments are not permitted. The proceeds of the redemption of the Shares will only be paid on receipt by the Administrator of the Application Form and any supporting anti-money laundering/ financial crime or related documentation (with the original documentation, where required, to follow by post) as the Fund or the Administrator may require.

In this event, the limitation will apply pro rata so that all Shareholders wishing to have Shares of that Sub-Fund redeemed on that Dealing Day realise the same proportion of such Shares. Shares not redeemed, but which would otherwise have been redeemed, will be carried forward for redemption on the next Dealing Day. If requests for redemption are so carried forward, the Administrator will inform the Shareholders affected. The Articles contain special provisions where a redemption request received from a Shareholder would result in Shares representing more than five per cent of the Net Asset Value of any Sub-Fund being redeemed by the Fund on any Dealing Day. In such a case, the Fund may satisfy the redemption request by a distribution of investments of the relevant Sub-Fund in specie provided that such a distribution would not be prejudicial to the interests of the remaining Shareholders of that Sub-Fund. Where the Shareholder requesting such redemption receives notice of the Fund\u2019s intention to elect to satisfy the redemption request by such a distribution of assets that Shareholder may require the Fund instead of transferring those assets to arrange for their sale and the payment of the proceeds of sale to that Shareholder less any costs incurred in connection with such sale. The Articles provide that the Fund cannot effect a redemption of Shares, if after payment of any amount in connection with such redemption, the Net Asset Value of the issued share capital of the Fund would be equal to or less than Euro 40,000 or its foreign currency equivalent.

In any other case, it is the currency conversion factor determined by the Directors at the Valuation Point for the relevant Dealing Day as representing the effective rate of exchange applicable to the transfer of assets relating to the First and New Classes of Shares after adjusting such rate as may be necessary to reflect the effective costs of making such transfer; SP = the issue price per Share of the New Class as at the Valuation Point for the applicable Dealing Day; and F = the Exchange Charge (if any) payable on the exchange of Shares. An Exchange Charge of up to 2% of the redemption price of the Shares being exchanged may be charged by the Fund on the exchange of Shares but it is the intention of the Directors that such charge (if any) should not exceed such amount as is set out in Part I for the relevant Sub- Fund. Where there is an exchange of Shares, Shares of the New Class will be allotted and issued in respect of and in proportion to the Shares of the First Class in the proportion S to R. In certain circumstances, at the discretion of the Directors, Shareholders will be deemed to have exchanged their Shares in one class of Shares for Shares in another Class of Shares where the Sub-Fund operates a tier mechanism between Share Classes (for example Share Classes 4 to 7 of the Aviva Investors Sterling Liquidity Fund). In such an event the above provisions will apply except that the Shareholders will not be required to submit an exchange request and the \u201cExchange Charge\u201d will be waived. Limitations on Exchange Shares may not be exchanged for Shares of a different class during any period when the calculation of the Net Asset Value of the relevant Sub-Fund or Sub-Funds is suspended in the manner described under \u201cSuspension of Calculation of Net Asset Value\u201d below. Applicants for exchange of Shares will be notified of such postponement and, unless withdrawn, their applications will be considered as at the next Dealing Day following the ending of such suspension. The Fund, at its discretion, reserves the right to refuse to accept any application for exchange, or to compulsorily redeem Shares held by any Shareholder, without giving any reason where the Fund suspects market timing. Without limiting the foregoing, and as further described below, the Fund may not be used as a vehicle for frequent trading in response to short term market fluctuations (so called \u201cmarket timing\u201d). Accordingly, the Fund may reject any exchange requests (or may compulsorily redeem Shares) from any investor that it determines is engaged in market timing or other activity which it believes is harmful to the Fund or any"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 102, "text": "102 Sub-Fund. Calculation of Net Asset Value/Valuation of Assets General Where there is more than one class of Shares in a Sub-Fund in issue, the Net Asset Value per Share of any class is calculated by the Directors or their delegate by ascertaining the Net Asset Value of the relevant Sub-Fund as at the Valuation Point for that Sub-Fund for the relevant Dealing Day (to which the Directors or their delegate may apply a provision for duties and charges) and determining the amount of the Net Asset Value which is attributable to the relevant class of Shares. The Net Asset Value per Share of the relevant class is calculated by dividing that proportion of the Net Asset Value of the Sub-Fund which is attributable to the relevant class by the total number of Shares of the relevant class in issue at the relevant Valuation Point. The Valuation Point for each Sub-Fund is set out in Part 1 for the relevant Sub-Fund. The Net Asset Value per Share is the resulting sum rounded to the nearest seven decimal places (or such other amount as may be determined by the Directors at their discretion). The Articles provide for the method of valuation of the assets and liabilities of each Sub-Fund and of the Net Asset Value of each Fund. Pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, the Directors have, among other things, delegated to the Manager all of their powers relating to the valuation of assets and liabilities of each Sub-Fund. Calculation of Net Asset Value per share for LVNAV Money Market Funds Any LVNAV Money Market Fund shall calculate a constant Net Asset Value per share as the difference between the sum of all of its assets valued in accordance with the amortised cost method as described below and the sum of all its liabilities divided by the number of its outstanding shares. The constant Net Asset Value per Share of a LVNAV Money Market Fund shall be rounded to the nearest percentage point or its equivalent when the constant Net Asset Value is published in a currency unit. The constant Net Asset Value per Share shall be calculated at least daily. The difference between the constant Net Asset Value per Share and the Net Asset Value per share calculated in accordance with Article 30 of the Money Market Fund Regulation shall be monitored and published daily on www.avivainvestors.com. Where the constant Net Asset Value per Share deviates from the Net Asset Value per Share as calculated using the methodology for Variable NAV Money Market Funds (as provided for below) by more than 20 basis points any following subscriptions and redemptions in the Fund shall be undertaken at a price that is equal to the NAV per share calculated in accordance with the Variable NAV MMF valuation while (i) such 20 basis point deviation subsists or (ii) such deviation does decrease below 20 basis points but is above 15 basis points and in the case of (ii) the Manager deems it to be in the best interests of the Sub-Fund as a whole to continue to use the Variable NAV MMF Valuation.

The Net Asset Value per Share shall be calculated and published at least daily. Interim Dealing Cycles \u2013 Money Market Funds The Fund may offer intra-day dealing for Money Market Funds through Interim Dealing Cycles within which subscriptions and redemptions may be accepted for execution in that Interim Dealing Cycle where provided for in the relevant section of the Prospectus for a LVNAV Sub- Fund. Where Interim Dealing Cycles are offered to investors, it is done so at the discretion of the Manager. The Manager may, in its absolute discretion, run more or less Interim Dealing Cycles for a particular Class or Sub-Fund. Interim Dealing Cycles will be immediately suspended in the event of a Valuation Deviation. In addition to the calculation of Net Asset Value of an LVNAV MMF and review for a Valuation Deviation at each Valuation Point, the Net Asset Value will be subject to intra-day checks during Interim Dealing Cycles and at the Dealing Deadline to protect against undetected Valuation Deviations. The Manager, and its delegates, continually monitor for market and credit risks which may give rise to such a Valuation Deviation. Shareholders should note that Interim Dealing Cycles may be impacted by operational and settlement challenges and accordingly are subject to change. The number and/or time of Interim Dealing Cycles on any Dealing Day may vary as a result of such challenges. Subscriptions, Share transfers and redemptions may be included in a later Interim Dealing Cycle or at the Dealing Deadline for a Dealing Day if, for any reason, their application was not processed in time for the intended Interim Dealing Cycle. Valuation of Money Market Funds 1. The assets of Money Market Funds shall be valued at the relevant Valuation Point using mark-to-market whenever possible subject to the derogation set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 below. 2. When using mark-to-market, the assets of the Money Market Fund shall be valued at the more prudent side of bid and offer unless the asset can be closed out at mid-market. The Manager will only use good quality market data and such data shall be assessed by the Manager on the basis of all of the following factors: \uf0b7 The number and quality of the counterparties; \uf0b7 The volume and turnover in the market of the asset of the Money Market Fund; \uf0b7 The issue size and the portion of the issue that the Money Market Fund plans to buy or sell. 3. Where use of mark-to-market is not possible or the market data is not of sufficient quality, an asset of a Money Market Fund shall be valued conservatively by using mark- to-model. The model shall accurately estimate the intrinsic value of the asset of a Money Market Fund, based on all of the following up-to-date key factors:"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 104, "text": "104 \uf0b7 The volume and turnover in the market of that asset; \uf0b7 The issue size and the portion of the issue that the Money Market Fund plans to buy or sell; \uf0b7 Market risk, interest rate risk, credit risk attached to the asset. When using the mark-to-model, the amortised cost method shall not be used. 4. By way of a derogation from the above, the assets of LVNAV Money Market Sub- Funds that have a residual maturity of up to 75 days will be valued using amortised cost method. 5. The amortised cost method shall only be used for valuing an asset of a LVNAV Money Market Fund in circumstances where the price of that asset calculated in accordance with the paragraphs 1,2 and 3 does not deviate from the price of that asset calculated in accordance with the amortised cost method by more than 10 basis points. In the event of such deviation, the price of that asset shall be calculated in accordance with paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 (as applicable). General Valuation \u2013 Non Money market Funds Money market instruments in a non-money market Sub-Fund may be valued by the Directors or their delegates at their amortised cost, in accordance with the Central Bank\u2019s requirements. Subject to the foregoing, any investments owned or contracted for by a Sub-Fund which are listed or dealt in on a Market the value thereof shall be based on the \u201clatest mid-market price\u201d, being the mean price between bid and offer prices for such security last available as at the relevant Valuation Point. Where such Investment is listed or dealt in on more than one Market the Manager shall select the Market which constitutes the main market for the foregoing purposes. Investments listed or traded on a regulated market but acquired at a premium or at a discount outside the relevant market may be valued taking into account the level of premium or discount at the date of valuation. The Articles also provide that the value of any investment which is not listed or dealt in on a Market or of any investment which is normally listed or dealt in on a Market but in respect of which (i) the Manager (as the Fund's delegate) shall determine that the amortised cost method of valuation is not appropriate and (ii) the middle market price is currently unavailable or the current price of which does not in the opinion of the Manager represent fair market value shall be the probable realisation value thereof estimated with care and in good faith by the Manager or a competent person appointed by the Manager, in each case approved, for such purpose, by the Depositary. In determining the probable realisation value of any such investment, a certified valuation thereof provided by a competent independent person or, in the absence of any independent person, the Investment Manager, who in each case shall have been approved for such purposes by the Depositary, shall be sufficient. The Articles also provide that valuations of units or shares or other similar participation in any collective investment scheme, which provides for the units or shares or other similar participation therein to be redeemed at the option of the holder out of the assets of that undertaking, shall be valued at the last available net asset value per unit or share or other similar participation as at the relevant Valuation Point or if bid and offer prices are published at the"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 105, "text": "105 last available bid price. The Articles further provide that the value of any cash in hand or on deposit, prepaid expenses, cash dividends and interest declared or accrued and not yet received as at a Valuation Point shall be deemed to be the face value thereof with interest accrued where applicable, unless in any case the Directors are of the opinion that the same is unlikely to be paid or received in full in which case the value thereof shall be arrived at after making such discount as the Directors may consider appropriate in such case to reflect the true value thereof as at any Valuation Point. The value of any demand notes, promissory notes and accounts receivable shall be deemed to be the face value or full amount thereof after making such discount as the Manager may consider appropriate to reflect the true current value thereof as at the relevant Valuation Point. Certificates of deposit, treasury bills, bank acceptances, trade bills and other negotiable instruments shall each be valued by reference to the best price available for certificates of deposit, treasury bills, bank acceptances, trade bills and other negotiable instruments of like maturity, amount and credit risk at the relevant Valuation Point. Forward foreign exchange contracts shall be valued by reference to the price as at the relevant Valuation Point at which a new forward contract of the same size and maturity could be undertaken, or, if unavailable, at the settlement price provided by the counterparty. The value of any exchange traded futures contracts, share price index futures contracts and options and other derivatives contracts which are dealt in on a Market shall be the settlement price as determined by the Market in question as at the relevant Valuation Point, provided that where it is not the practice for the relevant Market to quote a settlement price or such settlement price is not available for any reason as at the relevant Valuation Point, such value shall be the probable realisation value thereof estimated with care and in good faith by the Administrator or another competent person provided that the Administrator or such other competent person have been approved for such purpose by the Depositary. The value of any off-exchange derivative contracts shall be the quotation from the counterparty to such contracts at the Valuation Point and shall be valued at least daily.

If in any case a particular value is not ascertainable as above provided or if the Directors shall consider that some other method of valuation better reflects the fair value of the relevant investment, then in such case the method of valuation of the relevant investment shall be such as the Manager shall determine, such method of valuation to be approved by the Depositary"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 106, "text": "106 and the rationale used shall be clearly documented. Suspension of Calculation of Net Asset Value The Directors may at any time temporarily suspend the calculation of the Net Asset Value of any Sub-Fund and the issue, redemption and exchange of Shares and the payment of redemption proceeds during: (i) any period when any of the Markets on which a substantial portion of the investments of the relevant Sub-Fund from time to time are quoted is closed, otherwise than for ordinary holidays, or during which dealings therein are restricted or suspended; or (ii) any period when, as a result of political, economic, military or monetary events or any circumstances outside the control, responsibility and power of the Directors, disposal or valuation of a substantial portion of the investments of the relevant Sub-Fund is not reasonably practicable without this being seriously detrimental to the interests of Shareholders of the relevant Sub-Fund or if, in the opinion of the Directors, the Net Asset Value of the Sub-Fund cannot be fairly calculated; or (iii) any breakdown in the means of communication normally employed in determining the price of a substantial portion of the investments of the relevant Sub-Fund or when for any other reason the current prices on any Market of any of the investments of the relevant Sub-Fund cannot be promptly and accurately ascertained; or (iv) any period during which any transfer of funds involved in the realisation or acquisition of investments of the relevant Sub-Fund cannot, in the opinion of the Directors, be effected at normal prices or rates of exchange; or (v) any period when the Fund is unable to repatriate funds required for the purpose of making payments due on the redemption of Shares in the relevant Sub-Fund; or (vi) any period when the Directors consider it to be in the best interest of the relevant Sub- Fund; or (vii) when any other reason makes it impracticable to determine the value of a meaningful portion of the investments of the Fund or any Sub-Fund.

Remuneration Principles The Manager\u2019s employees' remuneration is designed in a way that is consistent with and promotes sound and effective risk management and does not encourage risk taking which is inconsistent with the risk profiles, rules or instruments of incorporation of the funds that the Manager manages. The Manager\u2019s remuneration policy is in line with the business strategy, objectives, values and interests of the Manager, of the funds that it manages and of the investors in such funds, and includes measures to avoid conflicts of interest. The Manager has established its remuneration committee as a sub-committee of the board of directors of the Manager to determine the annual bonus pool, approve individual performance bonuses and to ensure that the application of the remuneration policy is in line with the applicable regulation in Luxembourg (the \u201cRemuneration Committee\u201d). The total remuneration of an individual consists mainly of some or all of the following remuneration structures: \uf0b7 Basic salary \uf0b7 Discretionary bonus \uf0b7 Long term incentive plan awards \uf0b7 Benefits (including Pensions) The remuneration structure is determined in a way that the fixed component represents a sufficiently high proportion of the total remuneration allowing the Manager to operate a fully flexible bonus policy, including the possibility to pay no variable remuneration component. Bonus pools and target calculations are based on the performance of the Manager as a business. Performance is measured over a multiyear period appropriate to the holding period recommended to the investors of the funds managed by the Manager in order to ensure that the assessment process is based on the longer-term performance of the funds and its investment risks and that the actual payment of performance-based components of remuneration is spread over the same period. Performance assessments include both financial and non-financial metrics. Individual bonuses are recommended by line managers, based on performance-, risk- and other parameters, and approved by the Remuneration Committee. The Remuneration Committee performs a review of the prior year\u2019s bonus allocation and determines, based on the risk adjusted performance and the information available, if some or all of the deferred part of the bonus should be reduced. In addition, the Remuneration Committee has the right, in appropriate circumstances, to require reimbursement of any annual performance bonus or long-term incentive payment from individuals. The remuneration in shares will be disapplied for staff working in control functions. Details of the Manager's up-to-date remuneration policy, including, but not limited to, the composition of its Remuneration Committee and a description of how remuneration and benefits are calculated, are available at https://www.avivainvestors.com/en- gb/institutional/investing-with-us/asset-classes/liquidity.html.

The Directors have been advised that the Fund will only be subject to tax on chargeable events in respect of Shareholders who are Taxable Irish Persons (generally persons who are resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland for tax purposes)(see relevant Irish tax definitions for more details). A chargeable event occurs on, for example: (a) a payment of any kind to a Shareholder by the Fund; (b) a transfer of Shares; and (c) on the eighth anniversary of a Shareholder acquiring Shares and every subsequent eight anniversaries; but does not include for example any transaction in relation to Shares held in a clearing system recognised by the Irish Revenue Commissioners certain transfers arising as a result of an amalgamation or reconstruction of fund vehicles and certain transfers between spouses or former spouses. If a Shareholder is not a Taxable Irish Person at the time a chargeable event arises no Irish tax will be payable on that chargeable event in respect of that Shareholder."}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 114, "text": "114 Where tax is payable on a chargeable event, subject to the comments below, it is a liability of the Fund which is recoverable by deduction or, in the case of a transfer and on the eight year rolling chargeable event by cancellation or appropriation of Shares from the relevant Shareholders. In certain circumstances, and only after notification by the Fund to a Shareholder, the tax payable on the eight year rolling chargeable event can at the election of the Fund become a liability of the Shareholder rather than the Fund. In such circumstances the Shareholder must file an Irish tax return and pay the appropriate tax (at the rates set out below) to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. In the absence of the appropriate declaration being received by the Fund that a Shareholder is not a Taxable Irish Person or if the Fund has information that would reasonably suggest that a declaration is incorrect , and in the absence of written notice of approval from the Revenue Commissioners to the effect that the requirement to have been provided with such declaration is deemed to have been complied with (or following the withdrawal of, or failure to meet any conditions attaching to such approval), the Fund will be obliged to pay tax on the occasion of a chargeable event (even if, in fact, the Shareholder is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland). Where the chargeable event is an income distribution tax will be deducted at the rate of 41% or at the rate of 25% where the Shareholder is a company and the appropriate declaration has been made, on the amount of the distribution. Where the chargeable event occurs on any other payment to a Shareholder, not being a company which has made the appropriate declaration, on a transfer of Shares and on the eight year rolling chargeable event, tax will be deducted at the rate of 41% on the increase in value of the shares since their acquisition. Tax will be deducted at the rate of 25% on such transfers where the Shareholder is a company and the appropriate declaration has been made. In respect of the eight year rolling chargeable event, there is a mechanism for obtaining a refund of tax where the Shares are subsequently disposed of for a lesser value. Where a Shareholder holds Shares in a nominee capacity, a declaration is required from the Shareholder that, to the best of its knowledge and belief, the beneficial owner is neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland if a tax liability is not to arise on a chargeable event. An anti-avoidance provision increases the 41% rate of tax to 60% (80% where details of the payment/disposal are not correctly included in the individual's tax return) if, under the terms of an investment in a Sub-Fund, the investor or certain persons associated with the investor have an ability to influence the selection of the assets of the Sub-Fund. Other than in the circumstances described above the Fund will have no liability to Irish taxation on income or chargeable gains. Shareholders Shareholders who are neither resident nor ordinarily resident in Ireland in respect of whom the appropriate declarations have been made (or in respect of whom written notice of approval from the Revenue Commissioners has been obtained by the Fund to the effect that the requirement to have been provided with such declaration from that Shareholder or class of shareholders to which the Shareholder belongs is deemed to have been complied with) will not be subject to tax on any distributions from the Fund or any gain arising on redemption or transfer of their Shares provided the Shares are not held through a branch or agency in Ireland. No tax will be deducted from any payments made by the Fund to those Shareholders who are not Taxable Irish Persons."}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 115, "text": "115 Shareholders who are Irish resident or ordinarily resident or who hold their Shares through a branch or agency in Ireland may have a liability under the self-assessment system to pay tax or further tax on any distribution or gain arising from their holdings of Shares. In particular where the Fund has elected not to deduct tax at the occasion of the eight year rolling chargeable event a Shareholder will have an obligation to file a self-assessment tax return and pay the appropriate amount of tax to the Irish Revenue Commissioners. Certain Irish resident an ordinarily resident Shareholders will be exempt from exit tax on distributions and gains on redemptions by the Fund provided the appropriate declaration is in place. Refunds of tax where a relevant declaration could be made but was not in place at the time of a chargeable event are generally not available except in the case of certain corporate Shareholders within the charge to Irish corporation tax. Stamp Duty No Irish stamp duty will be payable on the subscription, transfer or redemption of Shares provided that no application for Shares or redemption or redemption of Shares is satisfied by an in specie transfer of any Irish situated property. Capital Acquisitions Tax No Irish gift tax or inheritance tax (capital acquisitions tax) liability will arise on a gift or inheritance of Shares provided that:- (a) at the date of the disposition the transferor is neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in Ireland and at the date of the gift or inheritance the transferee of the Shares is neither domiciled nor ordinarily resident in Ireland; and (b) the Shares are comprised in the disposition at the date of the gift or inheritance and the valuation date. Other Irish Tax Matters The income and/or gains of the Fund from its securities and assets may suffer withholding tax in the countries where such income and/or gains arise. The Fund may not be able to benefit from reduced rates of withholding tax in double taxation agreements between Ireland and such countries. If this position changes in the future and the application of a lower rate results in repayment to the Fund, the Net Asset Value of the relevant Sub-Fund will not be restated and the benefit will be allocated to the existing Shareholders in the relevant Sub-Fund rateably at the time of repayment. Relevant Irish Tax Definitions Irish residence and ordinary residence for tax purposes: (i) Residence - Company Prior to Finance Act 2014, company residence was determined with regard to the long- established common law rules based on central management and control. These rules were"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 116, "text": "116 significantly revised in Finance Act 2014 to provide that a company incorporated in the State will be regarded as resident for tax purposes in the State, unless it is treated as resident in a treaty partner country by virtue of a double taxation treaty. While the common law rule based on central management and control remains in place, it is subject to the statutory rule for determining company residence based on incorporation in the State set out in the revised section 23A of the TCA. The incorporation rule for determining the tax residence of a company incorporated in the State applies to companies incorporated on or after 1 January 2015. For companies incorporated in the State before this date, a transition period applied until 31 December 2020. (ii) Residence - Individual An individual will be regarded as being resident in Ireland for a tax year if s/he: 1. spends 183 days or more in the State in that tax year; or 2. has a combined presence of 280 days in the State, taking into account the number of days spent in the State in that tax year together with the number of days spent in the State in the preceding year. Presence in a tax year by an individual of not more than 30 days in the State will not be reckoned for the purpose of applying the two year test. From 1 January 2009, presence in the State for a day means the personal presence of an individual at any time during the day. (iii) Ordinary Residence - Individual The term \u201cordinary residence\u201d as distinct from \u201cresidence\u201d, relates to a person\u2019s normal pattern of life and denotes residence in a place with some degree of continuity. An individual who has been resident in the State for three consecutive tax years becomes ordinarily resident with effect from the commencement of the fourth tax year. An individual who has been ordinarily resident in the State ceases to be ordinarily resident at the end of the third consecutive tax year in which s/he is not resident. Thus, an individual who is resident and ordinarily resident in the State in 2022 and departs from the State in that tax year will remain ordinarily resident up to the end of the tax year in 2025. (iv) Intermediary This means a person who:- (a) carries on a business which consists of, or includes, the receipt of payments from an investment undertaking resident in Ireland on behalf of other persons; or (b) holds units or shares in an investment undertaking on behalf of other persons."}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 117, "text": "117 Other Jurisdictions As Shareholders are no doubt aware, the tax consequences of any investment can vary considerably from one jurisdiction to another, and ultimately will depend on the tax regime of the jurisdictions within which a person is tax resident. Therefore the Directors strongly recommend that Shareholders obtain tax advice from an appropriate source in relation to the tax liability arising from the holding of Shares in the Fund and any investment returns from those Shares. It is the Directors\u2019 intention to manage the affairs of the Fund so that it does not become resident outside of Ireland for tax purposes. Irish reporting financial institutions, which may include the Fund have reporting obligations in respect of certain investors under FATCA as implemented pursuant to the Ireland \u2013 US intergovernmental agreement and/or the OECD's Common Reporting Standard (see below). Information exchange and the implementation of FATCA in Ireland With effect from 1 July 2014 the Fund is obliged to report certain information in respect of U.S. investors in the Fund to the Irish Revenue Commissioners who will then share that information with the U.S. tax authorities. The Foreign Account Tax Compliance provisions of the U.S. Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act of 2010 ( FATCA), which imposes a 30% US withholding tax on certain 'withholdable payments' made on or after 1 July 2014 unless the payee enters into and complies with an agreement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service ( IRS) to collect and provide to the IRS substantial information regarding direct and indirect owners and account holders. On 21 December 2012, Ireland signed an Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) with the United States to Improve International Tax Compliance and to Implement FATCA. Under this agreement, Ireland agreed to implement legislation to collect certain information in connection with FATCA and the Irish and U.S. tax authorities have agreed to automatically exchange this information. The IGA provides for the annual automatic exchange of information in relation to accounts and investments held by certain U.S. persons in a broad category of Irish financial institutions and vice versa. Under the IGA and the Financial Accounts Reporting (United States of America) Regulations 2014 (as amended) (the Irish Regulations ) implementing the information disclosure obligations Irish financial institutions such as the Fund are required to report certain information with respect to U.S. account holders to the Revenue Commissioners. The Revenue Commissioners will automatically provide that information annually to the IRS. The Fund (and/or the Administrator, the Manager or the Investment Manager on behalf of the Fund) must obtain the necessary information from investors required to satisfy the reporting requirements whether under the IGA, the Irish Regulations or any other applicable legislation published in connection with FATCA and such information is being sought as part of the application process for shares in the Fund. It should be noted that the Irish Regulations require the collection of information and filing of returns with the Irish Revenue Commissioners regardless as to whether the Fund holds any U.S. assets or has any U.S. investors. If a Shareholder causes the Fund to suffer a withholding for or on account of FATCA (FATCA Deduction) or other financial penalty, cost, expense or liability, the Fund may compulsorily"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 118, "text": "118 redeem any Shares of such Shareholder and/or take any actions required to ensure that such FATCA Deduction or other financial penalty, cost, expense or liability is economically born by such shareholder. While the IGA and Irish Regulations should serve to reduce the burden of compliance with FATCA, and accordingly the risk of a FATCA withholding on payments to the Fund in respect of its assets, no assurance can be given in this regard. As such, Shareholders should obtain independent tax advice in relation to the potential impact of FATCA before investing. Common Reporting Standard (CRS) The goal of the CRS is to provide for the annual automatic exchange between governments of financial account information reported to them by local Financial Institutions (FIs) relating to account holders tax resident in other participating countries to assist in the efficient collection of tax. The OECD, in developing the CRS, have used FATCA concepts and as such the Standard is broadly similar to the FATCA requirements, albeit with numerous alterations. It has resulted in a significantly higher number of reportable persons due to the increased instances of potentially in-scope accounts and the inclusion of multiple jurisdictions to which accounts must be reported. Ireland is a signatory jurisdiction to a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement on the automatic exchange of financial account information in respect of CRS while section 891F and 891G of the TCA contain measures necessary to implement the CRS internationally and across the European Union, respectively. The Returns of Certain Information by Reporting Financial Institutions Regulations 2015 (the CRS Regulations), gave effect to the CRS from 1 January 2016. Directive 2014/107/EU on Administrative Cooperation in the Field of Taxation (\u201cDAC II\u201d) implements CRS in a European context and creates a mandatory obligation for all EU Member States to exchange financial account information in respect of residents in other EU Member States on an annual basis. Section 891G of the TCA contained measures necessary to implement the DAC II. The Mandatory Automatic Exchange of Information in the Field of Taxation Regulations 2015 (together with the CRS Regulations, the \u201cRegulations\u201d), gave effect to DAC II from 1 January 2016. Under the Regulations reporting financial institutions, are required to collect certain information on accountholders and on certain Controlling Persons in the case of the accountholder(s) being an Entity, as defined for CRS purposes, (e.g. name, address, jurisdiction of residence, TIN, date and place of birth (as appropriate), the account number and the account balance or value at the end of each calendar year) to identify accounts which are reportable to the Irish tax authorities. The Irish tax authorities shall in turn exchange such information with their counterparts in participating jurisdictions. Further information in relation to CRS and DAC II can be found on the Automatic Exchange of Information (AEOI) webpage on www.revenue.ie Information for UK Shareholders This information is a general summary of tax laws and practices; Shareholders should not consider it to be legal or tax advice, or as a guarantee of any particular tax result. The information is current as of the date of this Prospectus but may become out of date.

Except as noted otherwise, this information applies only to entities that pay taxes in the UK, and may not apply to all of them. General UK Tax Information Controlled foreign fund rules Under the UK Taxation (International and Other Provisions Act) 2010, there can be tax on UK tax resident companies that have a direct or indirect interest in 25% or more of the profits of a company that is based in a low-tax jurisdiction but controlled by UK residents. Attribution of gains of non-resident companies Under the UK Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, any company outside the UK that would be considered a close company if it were inside the UK can trigger tax implications for its owners. Specifically, any UK tax resident investor who owns, either individually or together with closely connected persons, 25% or more of such a company, could be liable, in proportion to their ownership of the company, for taxes on capital gains from a fund investment held by the company. Investment transactions It is the intention of the Fund that all assets held by the Sub-Funds will be held for investment purposes and not for the purposes of trading. Furthermore, it is considered that the majority of investments held by the Sub-Funds should meet the definition of an \u201cinvestment transaction\u201d as defined by The Investment Transaction (Tax) Regulations 2014. Income Distributions paid by a Sub-Fund to UK tax residents will be taxed as dividends unless the Sub- Fund\u2019s investment in debt (or similar) securities exceeds more than 60% of its total investments in which case the distribution will taxed as yearly interest where paid to UK tax resident individuals and as income falling in the loan relationship regime where paid to UK tax resident corporates. Shareholders subject to corporation tax will generally not have to pay tax on dividends (to the extent that the dividends are not recategorised as loan relationship income as described above) unless certain anti-avoidance provisions apply. Reporting Funds Regime In 2009, the UK Government enacted The Offshore Funds (Tax) Regulations 2009 ( the Regulations) by Statutory Instrument 2009/3001. This provides the framework for the taxation of investments by UK tax resident investors in offshore funds. The Regulations operate at a share class level, and effectively operate by reference to whether a share class of an offshore fund elects to be a Reporting Fund. All share classes which do not elect to be a Reporting Fund are regarded as Non-Reporting Funds. Under the Regulations, Shareholders in a Reporting Fund are subject to tax on their share of the UK Reporting Fund\u2019s income attributable to their shareholding, whether or not distributed."}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 120, "text": "120 Any gains made on the disposal of their holdings are subject to capital gains tax in the case of UK tax resident individuals, and, in the case of UK tax resident companies, coporation tax under either the chargeable gains regime or the loan relationship regime (depending on the underlying investments of the offshore fund as described above). Shareholders in a Non-Reporting Fund will be assessed to tax only on distributions received in respect of their shareholding. However, on disposal of shares in a Non-Reporting Fund, any gain will, in the case of UK tax resident indivduals, be charged to income tax at the shareholder\u2019s marginal rate of income tax rather than to capital gains tax and, in the case of UK tax resident companies, any gains will be taxed as income rather than as chargeable gains irrespective of whether or not the investment in the Non-Reporting Fund meets the condition to be treated as a loan relationship. Shareholders are advised to obtain independent tax advice to ensure that they are aware of the implications of investing in share classes which do or do not have UK Reporting Fund Status. Shareholders should note the information listed below. Application of the Regulations Under the Regulations, each share class of each Sub-Fund is considered a separate offshore fund. Reporting Funds To the extent practical, the Directors intends to operate the Fund so that its UK tax burdens will be mitigated as effectively as possible.

The Investment Manager will therefore seek to identify and invest in companies that are either focused on delivering sustainability solutions, exhibit the highest standards of corporate behaviour (when measured against national and international norms, see below) or are transitioning and evolving to become more sustainable and responsible. The Investment Manager believes that for the Sub-Funds that it manages adopting a purely exclusions-based approach or simply investing in today\u2019s sustainability leaders would limit the Investment Manager\u2019s ability to shape a sustainable future and not help to enable the transition to a low carbon economy. Real change requires a radical overhaul of the world\u2019s economy and industries and investors must be willing to support and be fully engaged in the transition from \u201cbrown\u201d to \u201cgreen.\u201d Creating a \u201cbetter tomorrow\u201d means we must play our part as investors in helping \u201ctoday\u2019s world\u201d become better. The Investment Manager also notes that the rise of ESG investing with a narrow focus on \u201cgreen\u201d companies has in many cases triggered inflated valuations which may ultimately undermine sustainability objectives and generate suboptimal outcomes for clients. The Investment Manager aims to identify both sustainability leaders and corporate and sovereign entities that have the potential and commitment to improve. The Investment Manager does this utilising a suite of ESG data tools alongside qualitative research generated by the Investment Manager\u2019s large, dedicated team of in-house ESG specialists. The Investment Manager will help catalyse and drive the required transition by using a variety of levers, including voting and engagement. At a firm-wide level, and separately to funds, the Investment Manager engages with governments, regulators and other entities to support them in bringing about well-informed policies and regulation to correct market failures, support the transition towards the development of a sustainable financial system and, in turn, support those companies that are providing solutions to sustainability-related challenges \u2013 this is what the Investment Manager terms \u201cmacro stewardship\u201d. How the Investment Manager considers adverse sustainability impacts. The Investment Manager recognises that certain investment decisions may cause or contribute to negative effects on sustainability factors relating to environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and anti-bribery (\u201cadverse sustainability impacts\u201d). In the context of the Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulation (SFDR), the most significant adverse sustainability impacts on sustainability factors that are material or likely to be material are referred to as principal adverse impacts (\u201cPAI\u201d). The SFDR implementing regulation (Regulatory Technical Standards) provides for 14 mandatory PAI indicators for corporate issuers and a smaller selection of mandatory indicators for government debt and real estate assets. These mandatory indicators range from carbon emissions, fossil fuel exposures and waste levels to gender diversity, due diligence on human rights and exposure to controversial weapons. In addition, SFDR also proposes a large number of voluntary environmental and social indicators from which asset managers"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 135, "text": "135 subject to SFDR must select two as a minimum. The voluntary indicators selected by the Investment Manager can be found in the Investment Manager\u2019s PAI Statement available on its website noted below. The Investment Manager integrates qualitative and quantitative data on PAIs into its investment processes. While the PAIs of investment decisions are currently not considered at entity level, i.e., by neither the Management Company nor the Investment Manager in accordance with the requirements of article 4(1)(a) SFDR, the Investment Manager has decided to integrate the consideration of PAIs into its responsible investment philosophy for Sub-Funds managed by the Investment Manager, which are subject to Article 8 SFDR (\u201cArticle 8 Sub- Funds\u201d). The investment teams have access to data and analytical tools relating to the PAI indicators and consider all mandatory and selected voluntary indicators as part of the investment process for Article 8 Sub-Funds. The Investment Manager\u2019s PAI Statement is available on its website here: https://www.avivainvestors.com/en-gb/capabilities/sustainable-finance-disclosure- regulation/. The Investment Manager\u2019s ESG approach ESG considerations are made throughout the investment process but the following key ESG factors apply as part of the ESG process applicable to the Article 8 Sub-funds managed by the Investment Manager. 1) The ESG Baseline Exclusions Policy 2) Corporate Good Governance Qualitative Assessment 3) Approved Issuer Process 4) Continual review of fund and issuer ESG performance 5) Engagement with held issuers to promote positive sustainable outcomes and to support the investment decision making process. The above ESG factors, as well as other ESG considerations, will impact the Article 8 Sub- Funds to a varying degree depending on each Sub-Fund\u2019s particular investment objective and/or investment policy, and may not be applicable to certain Sub-Funds which are not Article 8 as noted herein. 1. The ESG Baseline Exclusions Policy (BEP) There are specific sectors and economic activities where the Investment Manager considers the harm caused to the climate, planet and people to be so severe, that providing equity and debt funding is fundamentally misaligned with its sustainability philosophy. In these cases the Investment Manager forgoes the opportunity to engage, and actively excludes companies and industries from the Sub-Funds\u2019 investment universe. On an exceptions basis and at all times acting in accordance with the principles of the ESG Baseline Exclusions Policy, the Investment Manager may decide not to add a company to the exclusion list when it has exceeded the relevant threshold if in the Investment Manager\u2019s opinion this was not a result of a deliberate action taken by the company and/or will only likely be temporary in nature or because of planned actions by the company to reduce revenues from the relevant activity. Examples of this would be if the relevant company had exceeded the"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 136, "text": "136 threshold because of commodity price volatility and not because of actions taken by the company to increase revenues from the excluded activity or where the company has corporate actions planned to mitigate activity from the revenue generating activity. Exceptions: \uf0b7 Temporary revenue fluctuations - This applies when the exclusion revenue threshold is exceeded due to short-term market movements (e.g., commodity price fluctuations) (not expected to exceed 12 months but could be extended if deemed appropriate). \uf0b7 Post -acquisition revenue fluctuations \u2013 This applies when an acquisition/takeover triggers a revenue-based exclusion, but where formally announced corporate actions will bring the issuer's revenues back in the threshold limit within a reasonable timeframe (not expected to exceed 24 months). Monitoring: \uf0b7 The Investment Manager identifies situations likely to fall under these exceptions as part of their BEP update process that takes place at least every six months. As part of their BEP process, the exclusion list additions, removals, and exceptions require approvals from the relevant ESG internal governance committees. If the exception conditions are no longer met, the company is added to the exclusion list. The products, services and behaviours that the Investment Manager considers to be fundamentally misaligned to its core values predominantly focuses on issuers that meet the following criteria: \uf0b7 Manufacture products that cause undue human suffering or fatalities when used as intended and are subject to widely accepted conventions and norms that have been developed to control their use; \uf0b7 Manufacture products that cause unmitigated environmental harm and are inconsistent with the widely accepted conventions and norms; or \uf0b7 Demonstrate poor corporate behaviour that is deemed to be in violation of widely accepted conventions and norms.

Further details on Baseline ESG Exclusions is available in the Investment Manager\u2019s Baseline Exclusions Policy at https://www.avivainvestors.com/en-ie/about/responsible- investment/policies-and-documents/, which will be updated to reflect the above exclusions. 2. Corporate Good Governance Qualitative Assessment The Investment Manager\u2019s aim is for all Article 8 Sub-Funds which it manages to invest in companies that are part of the ESG assessment that follow good governance practices, such as having sound management structures in place, maintaining good employee relations, remunerating staff fairly, and complying with tax regulations. The Investment Manager will avoid investments in companies that fail to protect the basic rights of investors and employees, that are involved in tax evasion, corruption or other governance scandals (and fail to take adequate remedial action). Specifically, in addition to alignment with the standards set out in its voting policy (https://static.aviva.io/content/dam/aviva-investors/main/assets/about/responsible- investment/our-approach-to-responsible-investment/downloads/2024-global-voting- policy.pdf), the Investment Manager will only invest in companies that maintain governance practices in line with national standards. The Investment Manager also expects companies to act in accordance with the UN Guiding Principles and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. A qualitative ESG assessment forms part of the Investment Manager\u2019s research process, based on its knowledge of the company, together with a combination of MSCI governance and controversies data points. For asset-backed securities holdings, good governance is applied via compliance with the Securitisation Regulation and appropriate due diligence on the securities contractual arrangements and structure. Asset-backed securities are not corporate investments in the specific sense of this SFDR good governance concept and so follow a different process to the wider investment processes described for the other investments of the Sub-Fund. 3. Approved Issuer Process An ESG assessment is included alongside the Internal Credit Quality Assessment Procedures"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 139, "text": "139 in the Approved Issuer Process from which the investment portfolio is constructed and actively managed. Before an investment can be included on the approved issuer list there must be a consensus view in terms of the appropriateness of that investment. ESG analysis is conducted to inform of the ESG quality of an issuer, where data is available. The issuer may not pass the approval process and be eligible for investment if material ESG risks are identified. These risks could include sufficiently poor governance relative to peers or involvement in egregious ESG controversies lacking sufficient remediation. Asset-backed securities are approved at issuance by the credit analyst and portfolio managers and are subject to compliance with the Securitisation Regulation. An ESG assessment will be captured as part of this process as disclosures improve and the industry advances in an approach to ESG assessment for asset-backed securities. 4. Continual review of fund and issuer ESG performance The Sub-Funds and issuer ESG performance is regularly monitored reviewed by portfolio managers alongside credit analysts and ESG analysts. This process recognises that ESG assessments can change over time after an issuer has been approved. This process aims to assess past performance, identify ESG risks on a forward-looking basis and to take remedial actions such as engagement or applying temporary investment restrictions if ESG characteristics fall short of standards expected. This assessment is supported by quantitative ESG data provided by third parties as well as qualitative opinion formed by portfolio managers, credit analysts and ESG analysts. The reviews also provide opportunity to promote consideration of specific ESG characteristics of issuers, including but not limited to, climate strategies, responsible lending practices, biodiversity impacts, and remediation of ESG controversies. The application and materiality of these characteristics will vary depending on the business activities of the underlying issuers. 5. Issuer Engagement As part of the Investment Manager's ongoing stewardship responsibilities, they seek to engage with issuers where they have identified opportunities to promote better sustainability and governance related outcomes. Engagement may arise in response to controversies or where the Investment Manager has identified ESG characteristics of the issuer fall below standards that they expect. Engagement also provides portfolio managers, credit analyst and ESG analysts to better understand the ESG profile of an issuer on a forward looking basis. Summary The Investment Manager believes its combined approach as detailed above will maximise the real-world impacts of the Sub-Fund's investments while generating positive financial returns for shareholders. Financing and driving change is the very essence of responsible investment and underpins the Investment Manager\u2019s ESG philosophy and approach.

As a result of the requirements of SFDR, the Management Company is obliged to make certain disclosures in respect of its approach to the integration of sustainability risks as well as Sub- Fund specific disclosures on the likely impacts of sustainability risks on the returns of each Sub-Fund. Integration of Sustainability Risks The Management Company is required, under Article 6 of SFDR, to describe the manner in which sustainability risks are integrated into its decision-making process. As the Management Company delegates investment management of the Sub-Funds to the Investment Manager, its policy on the integration of sustainability risks relies on the application of the Investment Managers\u2019 own Sustainability Risk Policy in respect of each Sub-Fund. The Investment Manager recognises its duty as a trusted agent of the Shareholders\u2019 assets to endeavour to protect, maintain and grow the long-term value of their investments. Consistent with those obligations, the Investment Manager maintains a deep conviction that environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors and sustainability risks can have a material impact on investment returns. As a founder signatory to the United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (\u201cUN PRI\u201d), the Investment Manager has, for many years, used an integrated approach to the assessment of ESG factors and sustainability risks. This approach continues to evolve as markets have developed, resulting in access to more accurate information to help identify, measure and manage these factors and risks. As further detailed in the Investment Manager's Sustainability Risk Policy, the approach to responsible investing and the integration of sustainability risks are taken into account in a number of ways, and this approach is tailored to each asset class and strategy. ESG factors and sustainability risk indicators are integrated into each stage of the investment process and are considered alongside a range of financial and non-financial research. This is carried out in a number of ways, including: \uf0b7 Risk integration and identification: ESG and sustainability related characteristics, risks or impacts are identified and weighed against all other inputs when considering an investment decision, with no specific limits imposed, therefore the Investment Manager retains discretion over which investments are selected. \uf0b7 Stewardship: The Investment Manager actively engages with companies and uses voting rights, as applicable, with the aim of positively influencing company behaviour and helping to generate competitive returns. \uf0b7 Exclusions: The Investment Manager applies baseline ESG exclusions to investment in controversial weapons and civilian firearms. For further information on these exclusions and thresholds please see the Baseline ESG Exclusions Policy on the website: http://www.avivainvestors.com/en-lu/about/responsibleinvestment/."}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 141, "text": "141 \uf0b7 Please note, where additional specific exclusions may apply this will be disclosed in the relevant Sub-Fund descriptions.

At the date of this prospectus, there are no Sub-Funds that intend to make taxonomy-aligned investments that directly contribute to the environmental objectives as set out by the Taxonomy Regulation. Therefore, the Investment Manager considers that at least 0% of the Fund\u2019s investments are aligned with the EU taxonomy.

The investment objective of the Fund is to offer returns in line with money market rates and to preserve the value of the investment. The Fund is a Short-Term Low-Volatility Net Asset Value (LVNAV) Money Market Fund. The Fund is actively managed and will seek to invest in a diversified portfolio of high-grade Sterling denominated short term fixed or floating rate debt and debt related instruments including but not limited to commercial paper, term deposits, floating rate notes, certificates of deposit, freely transferable promissory notes, debentures, asset-backed securities and bonds. These can be issued from markets around the world but will typically be priced in Sterling. Investments which are not priced in Sterling will be hedged back to Sterling.

What is the asset allocation planned for this financial product? Asset allocation describes the share of investments in specific assets. Taxonomy-aligned activities are expressed as a share of: - turnover reflecting the share of revenue from green activities of investee companies - capital expenditure (CapEx) showing the green investments made by investee companies, e.g. for a transition to a green economy. - operational expenditure (OpEx) reflecting green operational activities of investee companies. It is expected that at least 60% of investments will be aligned with the environmental/social characteristics of the Sub-Fund in #1 where possible, however some assets will have no viable ESG data in instances where no viable quantitative data is available. There may on occasion be investments used for hedging or efficient portfolio management purposes (such as derivatives or securities lending) or liquidity holding purposes (such as cash equivalent) which would fall within \u201c#2 Other\u201d.

The investments shall be denominated in Sterling but may also be denominated in other currencies and hedged back to Sterling, and may be issued or guaranteed as to principal or interest by sovereign governments, their agencies and instrumentalities, supranational entities and EU and non EU corporations and financial institutions who are incorporated or domiciled in, or listed or dealt on a Market located in those jurisdictions listed in Appendix II hereto or in securities of issuers that, while not located in those jurisdictions, conduct substantial business in them as determined by the Investment Manager, including (i) companies which have substantial assets in those jurisdictions or (ii) companies which derive a substantial portion of their total revenues from either goods and services produced in, or sales made in, those jurisdictions. The Investment Manager intends where possible, to manage the Sub-Fund according to the restrictions imposed by the rating agency in order to maintain an overall credit rating of AAAf. The Sub-Fund promotes environmental and social characteristics however does not have a sustainable investment objective. To be eligible for investment, all investments that are selected as part of the Investment Manager's ESG analysis must follow good governance practices and not be excluded by the Investment Manager's ESG Baseline Exclusions Policy or other issuer screening criteria. It may however not be possible to perform ESG analysis on investments used for hedging and efficient portfolio management purposes. The Investment Manager integrates qualitative and quantitative data on adverse sustainability impacts into its investment processes. The ESG analysis and considerations described are incorporated into the investment process but may not always have a material impact on investments in the Sub-Fund. \uf0b7 What are the binding elements of the investment strategy used to select the investments to attain each of the environmental or social characteristics promoted by this financial product? The below criterion is binding on the investment process: Our firm-wide Baseline Exclusions Policy excludes issuers or securities that (a) exceed a maximum acceptable threshold of estimated revenue from the specific activities listed below; or (b) have materially violated the UNGC principles after taking into account any commitment to remediating action by the company. This assessment is underpinned by third-party data as well as internal analysis: - Controversial weapons - Coal - Non-conventional fossil fuels (arctic oil and tar sands) - Severe and very severe breaches of principles of the UN Global Compact; and - Tobacco. \uf0b7 What is the committed minimum rate to reduce the scope of the investments considered prior to the application of that investment strategy? The investment strategy guides investment decisions based on factors such as investment objectives and risk tolerance."}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 213, "text": "213 There is no commitment to a minimum rate target to reduce the scope of the investments considered prior to the application of the Investment Manager\u2019s investment strategy. Issuers that meet the criteria of the Investment Manager\u2019s ESG exclusion policy described above are excluded. The percentage of investments that are excluded from the Sub- Fund\u2019s investment universe will vary over time and be minimal given the nature of the investment universe and the approved issuer process incorporating an ESG assessment. Good governance practices include sound management structures, employee relations, remuneration of staff and tax compliance. \uf0b7 What is the policy to assess good governance practices of the investee companies? The Investment Manager\u2019s policy considers global best practice guidelines such as the ICGN Global Corporate Governance Principles and the G20/OECD Principles of Corporate Governance but are also informed by the Investment Manager\u2019s investment philosophy and numerous years of stewardship and voting experience. The Sub-Fund will not invest in securities from issuers that are in severe or very severe violation of the international norms and conventions set out by the United Nations Global Compact Principles. Investment in securities from issuers that fail to protect the basic rights of investors and employees through sound management practices or that are involved in tax evasion, corruption, or other governance scandals, will be avoided, unless they have taken adequate remedial action. The good governance criteria as outlined in the SFDR will be met through a combination of the UNGC (as part of the Investment Manager\u2019s ESG Baseline Exclusions Policy noted above) and a qualitative assessment as part of the investment analyst research process. Good governance indicators form a substantial component of the Investment Manager\u2019s ESG scoring tools and ESG research. Aviva Investors\u2019 ESG function, comprising governance and responsible investment specialists, provide analysis to support the Investment Manager\u2019s investment teams and help them in building a robust assessment of good governance practices. What is the asset allocation planned for this financial product? Asset allocation describes the share of investments in specific assets. Taxonomy-aligned activities are expressed as a share of: - turnover reflecting the share of revenue from green activities of investee companies - capital expenditure (CapEx) showing the green investments made by investee companies, e.g. for a transition to a green economy. - operational expenditure (OpEx) reflecting green operational activities It is expected that at least 60% of investments will be aligned with the environmental/social characteristics of the Sub-Fund in #1 where possible, however some assets will have no viable ESG data in instances where no viable quantitative data is available. #1 Aligned with E/S characteristics includes the investments of the financial product used to attain the environmental or social characteristics promoted by the financial product. #2Other includes the remaining investments of the financial product which are neither aligned with the environmental or social characteristics, nor are qualified as sustainable investments. The category #1 Aligned with E/S characteristics covers: - The sub-category #1A Sustainable covers sustainable investments with environmental or social objectives. - The sub-category #1B Other E/S characteristics covers investments aligned with the environmental or social characteristics that do not qualify as sustainable investments.

To comply with the EU Taxonomy, the criteria for fossil gas include limitations on emissions and switching to renewable power or low-carbon fuels by the end of 2035. For nuclear energy, the criteria include comprehensive safety and waste management rules. Enabling activities directly enable other activities to make a substantial contribution to an environmental objective. Transitional activities are activities for which low-carbon alternatives are not yet available and among others have greenhouse gas emission levels corresponding to the best performance.

Taxation in Germany The following provides a very brief overview of certain German income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of the Shares in the Company. By no means does it purport to be a comprehensive analysis of all of the German tax considerations rela ting to an investment in the Shares in the Company. In particular, it does not consider any specific facts or circumstances that may apply to any particular investor. Therefore, the following does not constitute, and cannot be construed as tax advice to any particular investor. In 2017 the Federal Republic of Germany reformed the Investment Tax Act. As a consequence, the following items of income in relation to an investment in the Shares in the Funds are generally taxable in the hands of German tax-resident investors as from January 1, 2018: 219"}, {"doc": "Prospectus_F00000O4Y0_1.pdf", "page": 220, "text": "\u2022 current distributions, including distributions of capital (Substanzaussch\u00fcttungen), by the Company; \u2022 advance lump -sums ( Vorabpauschale); the advance lump -sums correspond to the amount by which the distributions of the Company in a calendar year fall short of the basic income for such calendar year, which is determined by reference to 70% of the base interest rate; and \u2022 capital gains from a disposal, including a redemption, of the Shares in the Company. In general, these items of income are fully taxable. The applicable tax rate depends on the personal tax status of the particular German tax -resident investor. The tax due may be collected by way of German withholding tax (Kapitalertragsteuer). However, certain partial tax -exemptions ( Teilfreistellungen) exist for equity funds (Aktienfonds) and mixed funds ( Mischfonds). The amount of the partial tax -exemptions also depends on the personal tax status of the particular German tax -resident investor. There is no assurance that the Company qualify for the aforementioned partial tax -exemptions; but money-market funds should generally not qualify for such exemptions. Finally, all Shares in the Company held by German tax -resident investor are deemed to be disposed of at their redemption price on December 31, 2017 and deemed to be re -acquired at their redemption price on January 1, 2018. This deemed disposal constitutes a realization event for tax purposes. The capital gain realized as a result of the deemed disposal will be determined pursuant to the tax provisions applicable until December 31, 2017, but will be taxed only when the Shares in the Funds are actually disposed of. Prospective investors are strongly advised to seek professional advice concerning the tax consequences of acquiring, holding and disposing Shares in the Company prior to making the investment.
